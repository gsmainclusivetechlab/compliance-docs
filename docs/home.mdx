---

The GSMA Mobile Money API Compliance Verification Service is designed to support mobile money providers and third-party service providers who wish to comply with the harmonised industry specification on best practice 
in design and security. It grants a ‘GSMA Mobile Money API Compliant’ mark to API providers that demonstrate compliance with this industry specification. Compliance is determined by establishing that an API
provider has implemented the API for use cases which are relevant to their business, and that they have met baseline security conformance for operational and API security.

API providers who can demonstrate compliance will benefit from enhanced trust in
their solutions, helping them to attract third-party service providers to their platform, by proving adherence to best practice in flexibility, scalability and security. Third-party service providers who wish to integrate with the API provider will in turn
benefit from greater confidence and clarity during the integration process, and from greater  
prospects for scale upon integration.

The Compliance Verification Service currently supports the API versions and use cases described here, for which the latest version
provides use case views allowing users to focus only on the areas of the
specification which are relevant to their business. It will consider all use
cases supported by the GSMA Mobile Money API Specification as the industry continues to expand its adoption of the  
API, and as the specification itself evolves. If you are interested in achieving compliance for use cases not currently in 
scope, please register your interest here.
